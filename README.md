## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is being built using **React + Vite** with **vanilla CSS** for full styling control:

| Tool / Tech        | Purpose                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| [React](https://reactjs.org/)              | UI components and dynamic rendering         |
| [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)                | Blazing-fast frontend build tool            |
| [Plain CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) | Fully custom styling (no frameworks)       |
| [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  | Primary development environment             |
| [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)  | Planned deployment platform                 |

## üöÄ Deployment Plan

Deployment will be done using GitHub Pages, with a custom domain mapped via DNS. The Vite production build (`npm run build`) will output a static site that is deployable directly via GitHub Actions or manual push to the `gh-pages` branch.

## üß† Learning Goals

- Build a polished, personal website from scratch using React and CSS
- Practice component-based architecture and clean UI structure
- Customize styles without relying on a framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap
- Practice deploying modern web apps via GitHub Pages + custom domain
